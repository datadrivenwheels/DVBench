    "Final_Narrative": "Subject vehicle (SV) is traveling on a 6 lane undivided roadway with a center two-way lane in a business\/industrial area.  It is night and the road well-lit at regular intervals; traffic is light.  The SV is in the leftmost of the three through lanes with a leading vehicle (V2).  The center two-way lane becomes a left turn lane for oncoming traffic.  SV illegally crosses over double yellow line into this turn lane with intent to make a left turn at the traffic light further ahead. When the oncoming turn lane becomes a turn lane for the SV's direction of travel, V2 signals intent and begins to change lanes, cutting off the SV.  SV brakes hard and swerves left across the center line, slightly into the path of an oncoming vehicle (V3).  V2 brakes and steers back into its original lane. V3 passes SV and SV veers right, back into the center lane so as not to sideswipe V3. It is unclear from the video if V3 makes any evasive maneuvers.  SV slows to a stop to allow V2 to move over, then drives forward to the traffic light when it doesn't."
